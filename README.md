#### 1. Introduction
Fantasy Forge is designed to be an all-in-one platform for creative individuals looking to build and manage extensive fictional worlds. The app integrates several tools into a single environment, providing a seamless experience for users looking to write novels, manage RPG campaigns, or develop games.

#### 2. System Overview
Fantasy Forge will be developed using SwiftUI for a consistent experience across iOS and macOS devices. The app will leverage Core Data for local data management and synchronization capabilities across devices.

#### 3. Functional Requirements
- **User Interface**: Clean, intuitive, and responsive design that adapts to various device screens.
- **Data Management**: Robust backend using Core Data with capabilities to handle complex data structures and relationships.
- **Interactivity**: Advanced drag-and-drop interfaces and interactive elements like maps and timelines.
- **Customizability**: High level of customization for user interfaces and templates.

#### 4. User Stories
- As a novelist, I want to use templates to help structure my world's lore, so I can focus on creativity.
- As a game developer, I need to create detailed maps that are linked to my story elements, so players can explore my world cohesively.
- As an RPG manager, I want to track complex character relationships and historical data to enhance gameplay.

#### 5. Architectural Strategy
- **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**: This pattern will be used to promote a clean separation between the UI and business logic.
- **Modular Design**: Components like map builders and timeline creators will be modular, allowing users to customize their toolset.

#### 6. Detailed System Design
- Detailed component diagrams, sequence diagrams, and API documentation will be created to guide development.

#### 7. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Cover core functionality with unit tests.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure modules interact as expected.
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Involve real users to test the app in real-world scenarios.

#### 8. Launch Plan
- **Beta Testing**: Open a beta version to select users and collect feedback.
- **Release**: Launch on both iOS and macOS platforms, followed by marketing campaigns targeting novelists, RPG players, and game developers.

This structured approach in your README and Design Document will guide your team and inform potential users and contributors about the aims and functionalities of Fantasy Forge. Adjustments may be needed based on development progress and user feedback, but this foundation will help maintain clarity and focus throughout the project lifecycle.
